## BLU Language Transformation

Often times we use a 'transformation' instead of a function call. This is 
just syntactic sugar instead of using the function syntax to make your 
generators more readable.

Example: 
 >^^~ ^^titleCase(name)^^ ~^^ written as a transformation is ^^~ ^^name:titleCase^^ ~^^

Using the 'transformation' syntax the value before the ':' is passed as input
to the function after the ':'. This has limitations as you can only 
pass one parameter to the function. 

The value before the ':' does not have to be variable such as 'name'. It can
also be any other hard coded value.

Example:   
> ^^~ ^^"this is my string":camelCase^^ ~^^ =  ^^"this is my string":camelCase^^

Hint:

>   Strings used within expression must be stricly wrapped by DOUBLE QUOTES   
>   "my string " is a valid string, 'my string' is NOT a valid string
