## BLU Language Expressions

Anything inside two double caret characters ```^^~^^ ^^~^^ ``` is an **expression** that 
will be evaluated by the system to determine its value.

Example: 

  > Expression:  ```^^~^^~^^name^^~^^~^^``` evaluates to ```^^name^^```
  
You can use many inputs: variables, strings (within double quotes " "), numbers, null, boolean 
as valid inputs for expressions. 

Examples:

  > Expression:  ```^^~^^~^^"String Text Input"^^~^^~^^``` evaluates to ```^^"String Text Input"^^```
