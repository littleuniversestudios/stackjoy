## BLU Language Functions

BLU language also comes with executable functions.

Example:
> ^^~ ^^titleCase(name)^^ ~^^ = ^^titleCase(name)^^

There are other helper functions to help with determining paths to other files:

Examples:

  > Join two (..or more paths, usign paths as string pramaters ):
  >
  > ^^~ ^^join("/some/path", "some/other/path")^^ ~^^ = ^^join("/some/path", "some/other/path")^^
  
  
  > Join two paths (usiang a string & input parameter):
  >
  > ^^~^^join("/my/root/path",destination)^^~^^ = ^^join("/my/root/path",destination)^^
  
  > Join two path (using only inputs as parameters):
  >
  >^^~ ^^join(CODEBASE_PATH,destination)^^ ~^^ = ^^join(CODEBASE_PATH,destination)^^

  > Get a Relative Path (from starting folder to end folder):
  >
  >^^~^^relativeTo("/start/folder","/start/folder/end/folder")^^ ~^^ = ^^relativeTo("/start/folder","/start/folder/end/folder")^^
  
  > Get a Relative path To Codebase Root Folder
  >
  > ^^~ ^^relativeToCodebase(destination)^^ ~^^ = ^^relativeToCodebase(destination)^^

Relative to Codebase can also be written as:

  > ^^~ ^^relativeTo(destination,CODEBASE_PATH)^^ ~^^ = ^^relativeTo(destination,CODEBASE_PATH)^^
