# BLU Language Switch

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Example:
```^^~
strongPassword = "^^strongPassword^^"
[blu switch(strongPassword)]
    [blu switchCase="#SDFG34vdf$as&faw5n3**s"] This is a strong password. [/blu]
    [blu switchCase="as&faw5nfe"] This is an ok password [/blu]
    [blu switchCase="password"] The 90s called, they want their password back [/blu]
    [blu switchDefault] This will be shown if none of the above cases are triggered [/blu]
[/blu]
 ~^^```

Will result in:

```
strongPassword = "^^strongPassword^^"
[blu switch(strongPassword)]
    [blu switchCase="#SDFG34vdf$as&faw5n3**s"]This is a strong password.[/blu]
    [blu switchCase="as&faw5nfe"]This is an ok password[/blu]
    [blu switchCase="password"]The 90s called, they want their password back[/blu]
    [blu switchDefault]This will be shown if none of the above cases are triggered[/blu]
[/blu]
