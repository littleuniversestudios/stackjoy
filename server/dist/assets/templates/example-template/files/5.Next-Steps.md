5. Next Steps

Stackjoy offers a lot of functionality when it comes to extending your 
generators. Next step is to take a look at the documentation (found in 
the app menu via the hamburger icon in the header) to see all BLU 
Language possibilities within your generator.


We'll leave you with a couple of extra tidbits:

 1) Transformations

    A transformation is just fancy syntax for calling a function. 
    For Example:

    ^^upperCase("this is some text")^^ 
    can be written as: 
    ^^"this is some text":upperCase^^

    It only works if your function accepts one parameter and is 
    used to make your generator more legible. Using either is fine.

2) Switch Statements

    The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on 
    different conditions
    
    strongPassword = "^^strongPassword^^"
    [blu switch(strongPassword)]
        [blu switchCase="#SDFG34vdf$as&faw5n3**s"] This is a strong password. [/blu]
        [blu switchCase="as&faw5nfe"] This is an ok password [/blu]
        [blu switchCase="password"] The 90s called, they want their password back [/blu]
        [blu switchDefault] This will be shown if none of the above cases are triggered [/blu]
    [/blu]

If you're wondering where the "strongPassword" input comes from you can
find it in the ".config" on the left hand side. Take a look there 
in the "Variables" section.
