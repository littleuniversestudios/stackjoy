4. Functions

Functions allow you to extend more complex logic in your generators.

Stackjoy ships with some default functions such as:

^^ camelCase("this is some text") ^^
^^ constantCase("this is some text") ^^	
^^ paramCase("this is some text") ^^	
^^ pascalCase("this is some text") ^^	
^^ pathCase("this is some text") ^^	
^^ upperCase("this is some text") ^^	
^^ lowerCase("this is some text") ^^	

Check the documentation for the full list of default functions.

You can also create your own custom functions such as this one:

^^myCustomFunction()^^

If you're wondering where the "myCustomFunction()" comes from you 
can find it in the ".config" on the left hand side. Take a look 
there in the "Functions" section.

Please see the documentation under "Generator Config" for 
in-depth instructions on Functions.
