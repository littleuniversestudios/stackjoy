1. Expressions 

Anything inside double carets such as: ^^name^^ is an expression.

On the right, the generated file shows the evaluated expressions.

*******************************************************************
Try creating an expression. Put any word inside double carets:



Congrats, you just created your first expression.
********************************************************************

1)  Look above, the "Inputs" tab has a warning. Go there
    and fill the inputs in with any values and come back here.

    You'll notice that the generated file has taken the inputs 
    and evaluated them with the help of your expression.  

    Note: To create another expression you can press ctrl+space to 
    bring up code hints and select the "expression" option.

2)  Once all inputs are filled select the "Destination" tab to tell 
    Stackjoy where you would like to place the generated files within
    your codebase

3)  Once all the requirements have been met, the "Run" button will be 
    enabled and you can run your new generator. Go there and run it now.

    Once it has been run, go to your codebase. There you will see all 
    the generated files in a folder where you chose to place it in step 2.
