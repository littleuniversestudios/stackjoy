3. Iterators

Iterate over an array with BLU blocks.
[blu forEach(item in colors)]
    -> ^^item^^
[/blu]

If you're wondering where the "colors" input comes from you can
find it in the ".config" on the left hand side. Take a look there 
in the "Variables" section.

Please see the documentation under "Generator Config" for 
in-depth instructions about Variables. 


Note: A quick way to create a BLU block iterator is with code hints by 
pressing ctrl+space and selecting the 'blu' block then 'forEach' option
