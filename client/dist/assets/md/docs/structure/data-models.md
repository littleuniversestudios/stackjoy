## Data Models

Data Models describe data you may use in your project. They create metadata for this specific data. This metadata is then passed to the generator as in input to generate any code around this specific data.

For example you may use a user object in your project. You can create a "user" data model that has the following properties:

1. firstName
2. lastName
3. email

You can then pass this data model to a generator that creates an input form for your project.

The generator will use the metadata you created with the data model to create the form.
