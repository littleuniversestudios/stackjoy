## Codebase

This is your project codebase. Each Stackjoy [workspace](/documentation/structure/workspaces) must be associated with a codebase to work. Your project codebase is where the generated files will go.

Each workspace is associated to one codebase except for the FREE WORKSPACE. When you launch Stackjoy by typing
```
sj
```
Stackjoy will look at all your workspaces and try to match the path where it was launched from to a codebase in any one of your workspaces.

If it finds a match it will automatically select the matched workspace. 

Otherwise, it will assign the path where Stackjoy was launched from to the FREE
WORKSPACE. 

The FREE WORKSPACE does not require a login and is also a free floating workspace that goes from codebase to codebase depending on where Stackjoy is launched from. 

You can always change the codebase path as needed.
