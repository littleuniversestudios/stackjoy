## BLU Language Expressions

Anything inside two double caret characters ```^^ ^^ ``` is an **expression** that 
will be evaluated by the system to determine its value.

Example: 

  > Expression:  ```^^name^^``` evaluates to ```my-form```
  
You can use many inputs: [variables](documentation/generator/config/variables), [functions](documentation/blu-language/functions), strings (within double quotes " "), numbers, null, boolean 
as valid inputs for expressions. 

Examples:

| Expression | Evaluates to: |
|---|---|
|```^^"String Text Input"^^``` |String Text Input|
| ```^^55^^``` | 55|
| ```^^null^^``` |null|
| ```^^true^^``` | true|
| ```^^false^^``` |false|
