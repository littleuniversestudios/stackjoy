## BLU Language Transformation

Often we use a 'transformation' instead of a [function](documentation/blu-language/functions). call. This is 
just syntactic sugar instead of using the [function syntax](documentation/blu-language/functions) to make your 
generators more readable.

Example: 
 > ```^^titleCase(name)^^```  written as a transformation is  ```^^name:titleCase^^``` 

Using the 'transformation' syntax the value before the ':' is passed as an input
to the function declared after the ':'. This syntax is only intended for functions that only accept one parameter. 

The value before the ':' does not have to an input such as 'name'. It can
also be any other hard coded value, [variable](documentation/generator/config/variables) or a [function](documentation/blu-language/functions).

Example:   

```^^"this is my string":camelCase^^```  =  thisIsMyString


>   Hint: Strings used within expression must be strictly wrapped by DOUBLE QUOTES   
>   "my string" is a valid string, 'my string' is NOT a valid string
