## BLU Language Transformation

Often times we use a 'transformation' instead of a function call. This is 
just syntactic sugar instead of using the function syntax to make your 
generators more readable.

Example: 
 > ```^^titleCase(name)^^```  written as a transformation is  ```^^name:titleCase^^``` 

Using the 'transformation' syntax the value before the ':' is passed as input
to the function after the ':'. This has limitations as you can only 
pass one parameter to the function. 

The value before the ':' does not have to be variable such as 'name'. It can
also be any other hard coded value.

Example:   
>  ```^^"this is my string":camelCase^^```  =  thisIsMyString

Hint:

>   Strings used within expression must be strictly wrapped by DOUBLE QUOTES   
>   "my string " is a valid string, 'my string' is NOT a valid string         
                                                                             

Examples of other transformations available by default:


> Constant Case:     ```^^"this is my string:constantCase"^^```  = THIS_IS_MY_STRING
  
> Dot Case:          ```^^"this is my string:dotCase"^^```       = this.is.my.string
  
>  Param Case:        ```^^"this is my string:paramCase"^^```     = this-is-my-string
  
>  Pascal Case:       ```^^"this is my string:pascalCase"^^```    = ThisIsMyString
  
>  Camel Case:        ```^^"this is my string:camelCase"^^```     = thisIsMyString
  
>  Path Case:         ```^^"this is my string:pathCase"^^```      = this/is/my/string
  
>  Sentence Case:     ```^^"this is my string:sentenceCase"^^```  = this is my string
  
>  Snake Case:        ```^^"this is my string:snakeCase"^^```     = this_is_my_string
  
>  Title Case:        ```^^"this is my string:titleCase"^^```     = This Is My String
