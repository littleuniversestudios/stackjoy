# BLU Language Iterators

  You can iterate over an array that is passed as an input to the generator:  

Example:
``` 
  Input: colors = [^^colors^^];
  
  List of Colors:

  [blu forEach(color in colors)]
    Color [^^index^^] = ^^color^^
  [/blu]
```

Will result in:
```
  Input: colors = [yellow,blue,green];
  
  List of Colors:

  Color [0] = yellow
  Color [1] = blue
  Color [2] = green
  
```
