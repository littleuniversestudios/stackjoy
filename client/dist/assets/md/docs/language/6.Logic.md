# BLU Language Logic

BLU Language also has syntax for adding logic. For that we utilize a "BLU Block"

Example:  
``` 
    [blu if(5>2)]  This will be visible [/blu]  
    [blu if(5<2)]  This is not visible  [/blu]
 ```

Will result in:

```
This will be visible  

```
This is how you would use logic statements in a [template file](documentation/generator/template-files):
<img class="sj-image" src="/assets/md/images/blu-language/blu-logic.png" alt="BLU Language Logic" width="100%"/>

Full "If / Else if / Else" statements are supported as long as each if/else/elseif block 
comes right after the previous.

Example:
```  
    Your password is: "^^strongPassword^^"
    [blu if(strongPassword == "#SDFG34vdf$as&faw5n3**s")]This is a strong password.[/blu]
    [blu if(strongPassword == "as&faw5nfe")]This is an ok password[/blu]
    [blu else]"^^strongPassword^^" is not a strong password. Nice try 1999.[/blu]
```

Will result in:
```
Your password is: "password"


"password" is not a strong password. Nice try 1999.
```
