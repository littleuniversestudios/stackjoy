# BLU Language Inputs

An input is any value that is passed to the generator. It can be a [variable](documentation/generator/config/variables), [function](documentation/blu-language/functions), string, number, null, boolean

BLU language comes with some inputs by default; and you can always add you own too.

The most common input is **name**. It is the name that you give to the instance of a generator. 

  - The Name given to a generator:  
  ```  ^^name^^    =   my-form```
  
Here are some default inputs that are set by the system:

| Expression              | Generated Value                          | Description                                                             |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``` ^^filename^^ ```    | my-form.html                             | File name of a [template file](/documentation/generator/template-files) |
| ``` ^^basename^^ ```    | my-form                                  | Base File name of a template file                                       |
| ``` ^^extname^^ ```     | html                                     | File name extension of a template file                                  |
| ``` ^^destination^^ ``` | /codebase_root/my-form                   | Relative Path where this generator will be generated                    |
| ``` ^^filePath^^ ```    | /codebase_root/path-to-file/my-form.html | File Path where this generator will be generated                        | 
  |``` ^^CODEBASE_PATH^^ ```   | /codebase_root/server                    | Absolute path to your codebase associated with this workspace           |

Generators have a hierarchical lookup order when trying to evaluate an input that comes from a variable or a function. You can read more about the [hierarchy order here](documentation/structure/hierarchy).
