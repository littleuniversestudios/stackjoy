# BLU Language Inputs

An input is any value that is passed to the generator. It can be a variable, string 
(within double quotes " "), numbers, null, boolean

  ``` ^^filename^^    =   3.Inputs.md```


  - Base File name of this generator:  
  ``` ^^basename^^    =   3.Inputs```
  

  - File name extension of this generator:  
  ``` ^^extname^^    =   md```
  

  - Relative Path where this generator will be gererated:  
  ``` ^^destination^^    =   /codebase_root/STACKJOY```


  - File Path where this generator will be gererated:  
  ``` ^^filePath^^    =   /codebase_root/STACKJOY/2.BLU_Language/3.Inputs.md```


  - Absolute path to your codebase associated with this workspace:  
  ``` ^^CODEBASE_PATH^^    =   /codebase_root/server```

>   to get all code hints (cursor/focus must is in the file otherwise
