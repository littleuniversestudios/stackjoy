## BLU Language Functions

BLU language also comes with executable functions.

Example:
>  ```^^titleCase(name)^^```  = Stackjoy

There are other helper functions to help with determining paths to other files:

Examples:

  > Join two (..or more paths, using paths as string parameters ):
  >
  >  ```^^join("/some/path", "some/other/path")^^```  = /some/path/some/other/path
  
  
  > Join two paths (using a string & input parameter):
  >
  > ```^^join("/my/root/path",destination)^^``` = /my/root/path/codebase_root/STACKJOY
  
  > Join two path (using only inputs as parameters):
  >
  > ```^^join(CODEBASE_PATH,destination)^^```  = /codebase_root/STACKJOY

  > Get a Relative Path (from starting folder to end folder):
  >
  > ```^^relativeTo("/start/folder","/start/folder/end/folder")^^```  = end/folder
  
  > Get a Relative path To Codebase Root Folder
  >
  > ```^^relativeToCodebase(destination)^^```  = ../..

Relative to Codebase can also be written as:

  >  ```^^relativeTo(destination,CODEBASE_PATH)^^```  = ../..
