# BLU Language Switch

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Example:
```
strongPassword = "^^strongPassword^^"
[blu switch(strongPassword)]
    [blu switchCase="#SDFG34vdf$as&faw5n3**s"] This is a strong password. [/blu]
    [blu switchCase="as&faw5nfe"] This is an ok password [/blu]
    [blu switchCase="password"] The 90s called, they want their password back [/blu]
    [blu switchDefault] This will be shown if none of the above cases are triggered [/blu]
[/blu]
 ```

Will result in:

```
strongPassword = "password"

    
    The 90s called, they want their password back
    

```

This is how you would use a switch in a [template file](documentation/generator/template-files):

The input `strongPassword` is provided to the generator via the [Inputs](/documentation/generator/inputs) form as such:
