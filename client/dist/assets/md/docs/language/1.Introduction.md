## BLU Language

Stackjoy has its own scripting language BLU (short for Blueprint). This Language can be
sprinkled into any [template file](documentation/generator/template-files), quickly turning it into a [generator](documentation/generator/introduction). This generator can then be
(re)used to generate the desired code.

The main components of the BLU language are:

| Section | Description |
|---|---|
|[Expressions](documentation/blu-language/expressions) | they evaluate inputs, variables, constants into text.|
| [Inputs](documentation/blu-language/inputs) |  any type of value (simple or complex) passed into a generator for evaluation |
| [Functions](documentation/blu-language/functions) |  Lambda functions for more complex evaluation of inputs |
| [Transformations](documentation/blu-language/transformations) |  Special type of syntax that passes and input into a function |
| [Logic](documentation/blu-language/logic) |  If/Else If/ Else statements |
| [Iterators](documentation/blu-language/iterators) |  "For Each" syntax to iterate over arrays or lists |
| [Switch statements](documentation/blu-language/switch) | "switch(somevalue)" syntax for multi option statements |

The language is somewhat unique in its syntax so that it does not collide with anything 
else within the code that is being generated. This was done on purpose because stackjoy 
works with any language so it was imperative that there were no collisions between the 
BLU Language and the language being generated.
