## Template Files

Template file(s) can be any file(s) that is used to generate the final code.

You can have one or many template files in your generator. You can also have folders 
that store template files. The folder structure will be preserved when running the 
generator in the finished output. 

You can use any file and any extension as your template file. When the template
file is generated it will set the same file name and extension in the generated file
as the template file. The generated file name can be changed in the [**filenames**](/documentation/generator/config/filenames) config 
section.

You can add [expressions](/documentation/blu-language/expressions), [functions](/documentation/blu-language/functions), [logic](documentation/blu-language/logic), [iterators](documentation/blu-language/iterators), [switch statements](documentation/blu-language/switch) to turn your
plain template files into **smart** templates. This just means that you can provide 
different [inputs](documentation/generator/inputs) to your generator and your logic within the template file(s) will 
dictate what is generated in the end.
