## Generators

A Generator is a collection of [template files](documentation/generator/template-files) combined with a [generator config](documentation/generator-config/introduction).

1. The [template files](/documentation/generator/template-files) as well as the generator [.config](/documentation/generator-config/introduction) file that extends the generator's capability.
2. The selected template file that can be [edited](/documentation/blu-language/introduction) to meet your project needs.
3. The read-only generated file that shows what the template file will look like once all the required [inputs](/documentation/generator/inputs) have been applied.



When run, the generator will apply all the provided [inputs](documentation/blu-language/inputs) and turn the template files 
into the genereated code for your project.
