## Running the generator

Once all the required [inputs](documentation/generator/inputs) have been provided and the [destination](documentation/generator/destination) has been selected
you can run the generator. However, if there are any syntax errors they will be presented and 
the run button will be disabled until the errors have been corrected.

Once the file(s) have been generated you will receive a confirmation.

Once the generator runs successfully the [On Success](documentation/generator-config/on-success) part of the generator will be 
evaluated and presented to the user for further instructions.
