## Generator Context

This section shows what [inputs](documentation/generator/inputs)  and [functions](documentation/generator-config/function)  are available to the generator. It's a quick
overview what the generator sees and the values that are present in the generator's context.

This is helpful when considering the [hierarchy pattern](documentation/structure/hierarchy) of execution and especially when there are 
[chained generators](documentation/generator-config/chains) . When generators are chained they may share the same [variable](documentation/generator-config/variables) / [input](documentation/generator/inputs)  but the value
may be different based on the generator's context. Here you can see exactly what value is available to which generator.
