## Chains

You can chain, or run multiple generators, one after the other. When you add other generators
to your main generator's chain the other generators will be executed afterwards. 

All of the [template files](documentation/generator/template-files) , from all the chained generators, will be visible the in the template
 file menu. Similarly, you can see what the generated files will look like in the Generated
 Files menu for all the chained generators.

Generators have a hierarchical lookup order when chaining multiple generators. You can read more about the [hierarchy order here](documentation/structure/hierarchy).
