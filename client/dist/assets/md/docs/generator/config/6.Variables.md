## Variables

This area is used to list, create, update and delete variables that can be used as [inputs](documentation/generator/inputs) 
within the template files. Variables can store values such as plain text, [expressions](documentation/blu-language/expressions) and 
[functions](documentation/blu-language/functions) or even other variables. 

The variables have a name, and a value property.

Some examples of variables:

| Variable Name | Variable Value | Generated Value |
|----|----|----|
| myVar | just some plain text |  just some plain text|
| myPath |  ```^^join(CODEBASE_PATH,"/shared-folder")^^```  |  /codebase/shared-folder|
| startFodler | /start-folder | /start-folder |
| endFolder|   ```^^startFolder^^```/end-folder | /start-folder/end-folder |


Generators have a hierarchical lookup order when trying to find a specific variable. You can read more about the [hierarchy order here](documentation/structure/hierarchy).
