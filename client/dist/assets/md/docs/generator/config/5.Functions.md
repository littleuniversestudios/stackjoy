## Functions

This area is used to list, create, update and delete custom functions that you 
can create for your generator. Custom functions are used when more complex logic
is required within the generator. Stackjoy also comes with some [default functions](documentation/blu-language/functions).

Custom functions have a name, description and a body property and is written in plain javascript.

This what a function call looks like in a [template file](/documentation/generator/template-files):

This is what a typical function body looks like:

```
(param) => {
  return param;
}
```

You can add as many parameters as is required for the function to execute.

The function also has access to the ```path``` [(Node path module)](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) and ```changeCase``` [(NPM Module)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/change-case) within it.

An example of a custom function:

```
(color) => {
    let response = "";
    switch(color){
        case "blue":
        response = "This is great color";
        break;
        default:
        response = "This is not a great color";
        break;

    }
  return response;
}
```



Generators have a hierarchical lookup order when trying to find a specific function. You can read more about the [hierarchy order here](documentation/structure/hierarchy).
