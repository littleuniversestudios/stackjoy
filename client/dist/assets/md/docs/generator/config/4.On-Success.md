## On Success

When the generator finishes running you can present more information
such as instructions on what to do next. This can be set in the 'On Success'
section of the config.

You can add text, [expressions](documentation/blu-language/expressions) and [functions](documentation/generator-config/functions)  to the On Success text block.

You can also use back ticks `` to mark parts of the On Success text. These
specially marked areas can be automatically copied when presented to the user 
after the generator is finished running.

When you successfully run a generator you will see a "Further Instructions" section. However, this section will only be present if the generator's 'On Success' is not empty.
