## Generator Config

Generator config extends the capabilities of the generator. In this section you can change some of the properties and behavior of the generator.

These sections include:

| Section                                                   | Description|
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| [Readme](documentation/generator/config/readme)           | Detailed instructions in .md (markdown) format that you can add as documentation for your genereator |
| [Description](documentation/generator/config/description) | Quick description of the generator that will appear through out the app |
| [Filenames](documentation/generator/config/filenames)     | How the template file filenames will be treated when they are generated |
| [On Success](documentation/generator/config/on-success)   | Extra instructions that will appear once the generator finishes runnin |
| [Functions](documentation/generator/config/functions)     | Section to manage which custom functions are present for the generator |
| [Variables](documentation/generator/config/variables)     | Section to manage which custom variables are present for the generator |
| [Chains](documentation/generator/config/chains)           | Run generators one after the other in chained succcession |
| [Context](documentation/generator/config/constext)        | All the present inputs and functions that the generator sees in its current context |

Generators have a hierarchical lookup order when trying to determine some of the config properties. You can read more about the [hierarchy order here](documentation/structure/hierarchy).
