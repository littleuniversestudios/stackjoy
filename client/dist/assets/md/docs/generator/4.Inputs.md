## Generator Inputs

Generator [Inputs](documentation/blu-language/inputs) are values that are passed to the generator and are then used in the
[template files](documentation/generator/template-files) as [expressions](documentation/blu-language/expressions).

The inputs are usually passed to the generator by the user (you) by filling out the 
Inputs Form when running the generator.

Most inputs are treated as strings when added to the Inputs Form.

However, you can also use an array by separating the values with commas such as: ```blue,red,green```

Inputs can also come from the [variables](documentation/generator-config/variables) found in the generator [config](documentation/generator-config/introduction).
