## Stackjoy Community

The Stackjoy Community is where you will find public [stacks](/documentation/structure/stacks) that have been created by other users. These stacks may have only [generators](/documentation/generator/introduction) or they may be [starter-stacks](/documentation/community/starter-code) that have
starter code that comes with the generators.

You can bring community stacks into your current workspace by installing them. Once installed, the generators from the community stack will appear in your workspace generators.

Once the generators from the community stack are in your workspace you can edit them as if they were your own.


> When you install a stack from the community you are installing an instance (a copy) of the generators. If you were to install the same community stack you will get another instance of the same generators in your workspace. You will end up 2x of the same generators.


If a stack has starter code in it, Stackjoy will prompt you to download the starter code and place it in your current workspace [codebase](/documentation/structure/codebase).

To delete a community stack from your workspace. Go to Workspace > Structure and select the instance of the stack you installed. Once selected you can access the "More Actions" menu and select "Delete Stack". Deleting a stack is a permanent action and cannot be undone. If you've made changes to the
generators that came from a public stack and then deleted the public stack, the changes you made (along with the generators) will be gone.
