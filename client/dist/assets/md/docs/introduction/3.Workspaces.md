## Stackjoy Workspaces

- A stackjoy workspace stores the generators for your specific codebase.
- It is associated with a codebase by assigning a path to the root of your codebase. This path can be changed at any point.
- Each one of your codebases can have its own workspace.
- A Workspace can be shared with other members of your project.


### The FREE WORKSPACE

- Can be used without an account (no login required). 
- Majority of the functionality is available on the FREE WORKSPACE but for complete functionality a stackjoy account is required.
