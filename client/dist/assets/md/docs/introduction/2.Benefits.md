## Why Use Stackjoy?

### Save time, be more productive

Get going quickly, keep moving swiftly. 
Use console like commands to quickly generate different components (parts of the software) 
and place them directly into your codebase.

### Language Agnostic

Stackjoy will work with any programming language or framework. It is designed for every 
developer in mind. If some piece of code can be generated and needs to be repeated, 
Stackjoy will help you do it.

### New **OR** Existing Codebase

Whether you have an existing project or are starting a new one you can use Stackjoy to
help speed up your software development. Use one of the stacks with starter code to get
going on a new project or simply install just the needed templates to speed up development
of your current project.

### Great for Onboarding

New Developers to the project can find comfort in knowing that they can generate critical
parts of the software system by running simple commands that were authored and approved
by current team members. This allows them to start contributing faster, be more confident
in their contributions, and keep the consistency that is expected and set by the current team.

### Share across the project or team

Easily share your templates with other members of the team. Update and modify current 
generators and push them out to your team members. Once a team member logs into their 
Stackjoy platform they can start using every template shared by the team.

### Consistent Code

Different developers can generate same types of components (or any parts of software) from
different data models keeping the overall codebase consistent making future upgrades and 
maintenance much easier to deal with. Developers can jump form one part of the application
to another knowing that they will be familiar with different parts of the application in
turn speeding up the overall development. 

### Stacks

Store templates, data models and a starter code repository in a stack and use it for your
next project or share it with others. Stack other stacks into your stack and create a 
super stack. 

### Portability

Starting a new project and already have a stackjoy workspace with generators from an older
project? Duplicate your current workspace and point it to your new codebase and you 
are ready to re-use your generators in your new project.

### Your Files are **THE** Templates

No need to generate metadata describing what your template does. A file from your 
application/code (with itâ€™s file extension) **IS** the template. 

### Quick and Easy Template Creation

Easily turn any project file into a generator directly form your codebase. Once created, 
adjust it so that it can be generated using other input data to quickly replicate 
its contents.
