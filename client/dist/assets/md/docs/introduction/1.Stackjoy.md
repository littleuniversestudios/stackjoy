### Build Software Faster

Stackjoy is a software development tool to speed up your development process. It works with 
your current codebase or if you're staring a new one. It is based on generators (or simply 
templates) that can be created, edited, updated and finally applied to your codebase. The 
generators (templates) can be chained together to form more complex templates. They can 
receive inputs (any kind of data) to create the desired code. It works with any software 
language so you can use it with any part of your tech stack. All of this can be shared with
your teammates to promote consistency, collaboration, code quality and much more.


### For All Developers

Stackjoy works with any language, any framework, any library. You don't even need to be 
writing software to use it. You can use it to write a book, or customized emails. It 
generates "text" in any readable format. Stackjoy has its own scripting language to 
accomplish this. [BLU Language (short for Blueprint) ](/documentation/blu-language/introduction) can be sprinkled into any file quickly
turning it into a generator that can then be (re)used to create the desired code.

### Development Tool

Stackjoy is not a library or framework, or low/no code prototyping tool. You can use it as 
little or as much as you'd like. You can use with your current codebase or use it to start a
new project. It is meant to be shared with team members or with the public. Think of it like
a hammer. The hammer does not know what you're building. It's there when you need it. It sits
idly when you don't. It works across a wide range of projects, everyone has a use for it, 
and it provides tremendous value for what it does.

### Stateless

Stackjoy does not know the "state" of your project/codebase. That is partially why it works
with any software language. It is good at creating (generating) desired text that can be 
stored as file(s). While it can update your files, it really shines when creating new files. 
That is why it does not need to understand how your project works, it just needs to know
what to generate and where to store it.
