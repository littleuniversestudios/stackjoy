# How To Install

```js
npm install stackjoy -g
```

Once installed go to the root of your codebase in the terminal of your choice and type

```prompt
sj
```

And that's it. 

If everything was installed correctly a new browser page will open with the Stackjoy platform.

## Dependencies 

Stackjoy is dependent on NPM (Node Package Manager) and GIT. To use Stackjoy you'll need those two things. Naturally to use NPM you'll need Node.js.

GIT is used for installing and sharing workspaces and stacks. Every stackjoy workspace/stack is a git repository which can be shared/collaborated with others.
