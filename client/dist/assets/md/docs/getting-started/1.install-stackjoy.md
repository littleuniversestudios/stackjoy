## Install Stackjoy

Stackjoy is installed via the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/about) (npm).

To install stackjoy, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm i stackjoy -g
```

Once installed, go to the root of your codebase in a terminal and type:
```
sj
```

This will open Stackjoy in a web browser and point to a [Free Workspace](/documentation/structure/workspaces) that is automatically associated to your codebase.
