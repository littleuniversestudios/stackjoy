## Install Generators

### 1) Install From Command Line (terminal)

If you have found [generators](/documentation/generator/introduction) in the [stackjoy community](/community) and want to install them and run Stackjoy at the same time, go to the root of your codebase in a terminal and type:

```
sj install <name-of-generators-stack>
```

If, for example, you were installing generators for [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) called [postman-generators](/stack/postman-generators) you can do so by typing in a terminal at the root of your codebase:

``` 
sj install postman-generators
```

[Generators](/documentation/generator/introduction) are stored in `stacks` and you can learn more about stacks [here](/documentation/structure/stacks).

### 2) Install From the Stackjoy App
