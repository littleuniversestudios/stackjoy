## Run A Generator

To run a [generator](/documentation/generator/introduction) select it by clicking on it in the Workspace Generators section.

You will be presented with the generator execution flow. Notice the different sections that must be completed before the generator can be executed. Sections marked with an exclamation warning icon require some user input.

This is Generator section. It shows you the structure of the generator including:

1. The [template files](/documentation/generator/template-files) as well as the generator [.config](/documentation/generator-config/introduction) file that extends the generator's capability.
2. The selected template file that can be [edited](/documentation/blu-language/introduction) to meet your project needs.
3. The read-only generated file that shows what the template file will look like once all the required [inputs](/documentation/generator/inputs) have been applied.

Clicking on the "Inputs" sections will show all the required [inputs](/documentation/generator/inputs) that this particular generator requires. Once all inputs have been filled in a checkmark will appear in the section tab confirming that the section is complete.

The "Destination" section shows the folder structure of your project's codebase. Select the folder where you would like to place the generated files by clicking it on it. Once selected the folder will be highlighted and a  checkmark will appear in the section tab confirming that the section is complete.

Finally, once all inputs have been provided, the "Run" section button will be enabled. It will show all the files that will be generated along with the destination path where the files will be placed within your codebase. If any of the new files already exist in your codebase a overwrite warning will be visible.

Clicking on the "Run" button will generate and place the files into your codebase. You will see a confirmation of the generated files. If there are any [further instructions](/documentation/generator-config/on-success) they will also be presented here.

Lastly, you can look in your codebase to confirm that the generated file(s) have been placed in the correct location within your project.
